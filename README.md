# Revolutionary-Electronic-Polling-System
This is an innovative approach where the people can be allowed to cast their vote in the automated teller machines. 
This model can be expected to overcome the drawbacks of the current system because of which the percentage of votes registered never reaches 100%. 
With the help of this model we can expect increase in people’s participation in the election process. 
Here we propose a system, where in software is designed entirely dedicated for this purpose and can be installed in all the automated teller machines. 
On the day of election alone automated teller machines can be used to allow people to cast their vote. 
The procedure is as follows: 
  ➢ Get the details from the user. Store them in database. 
  ➢ When the user gives the details, verify with the database. 
  ➢ If the data’s match, allow him/her to caste vote. 
  ➢ Store the registered vote in the database. 
  ➢ Lock the voter so he/she can’t vote again. 
  ➢ Retrieve the registered votes on the day of counting.
