The Godhra town in Panchmahal District had the dubious distinction of having Communal Riots frequently and as a result of which Curfew had to be imposed in Godhra town very frequently during 1981-82.  Shri. Joti took charge of District Magistrate of Panchmahal District in June, 1982.  During his Two Years tenure upto July, 1984, Curfew was never imposed in Godhra Town.

The strategy adopted worked well and peace was restored in Godhra Town on a Sustainable basis.
