              <p align="justify"> India is a Socialist, Secular, Democratic Republic and the largest democracy in the World. The modern Indian nation
                state came into existence on 15th of August 1947. Since then free and fair elections have been held at regular intervals
                as per the principles enshrined in the Constitution, Electoral Laws and System. </p>
              <p align="justify"> The Constitution of India has vested in the Election Commission of India the superintendence, direction and control of
                the entire process for conduct of elections to Parliament and Legislature of every State and to the offices of President
                and Vice-President of India. </p>
              <p align="justify">Election Commission of India is a permanent Constitutional Body. The Election Commission was established in accordance
                with the Constitution on 25th January 1950. The Commission celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 2001.</p>
              <p align="justify"> Originally the commission had only a Chief Election Commissioner. It currently consists of Chief Election Commissioner and
                two Election Commissioners. </p>
              <p align="justify"> For the first time two additional Commissioners were appointed on 16th October 1989 but they had a very short tenure till
                1st January 1990. Later, on 1st October 1993 two additional Election Commissioners were appointed. The concept of multi-member
                Commission has been in operation since then, with decision making power by majority vote. </p>
              <div id="tt" align="right"><a href="#"><img src="./image/top.jpg" width="40" height="32" border="0"></a></div>
              <h3><a name="appointment-tenure" id="appointment-tenure"></a>Appointment &amp; Tenure of Commissioners</h3>
              <p align="justify"> The President appoints Chief Election Commissioner and Election Commissioners. They have tenure of six years, or up to the age
                of 65 years, whichever is earlier. They enjoy the same status and receive salary and perks as available to Judges of the
                Supreme Court of India. The Chief Election Commissioner can be removed from office only through impeachment by Parliament. </p>
              <div id="Div1" align="right"><a href="#"><img src="./image/top.jpg" width="40" height="32" border="0"></a></div>
              <h3><a name="transaction" id="transaction"></a>Transaction of Business</h3>
              <p align="justify"> The Commission transacts its business by holding regular meetings and also by circulation of papers. All Election Commissioners
                have equal say in the decision making of the Commission. The Commission, from time to time, delegates some of its executive
                functions to its officers in its Secretariat. </p>
              <div id="Div2" align="right"><a href="#"><img src="./image/top.jpg" width="40" height="32" border="0"></a></div>
              <h3><a name="elcmachinery" id="elcmachinery"></a>The Setup</h3>
              <p align="justify">The Commission has a separate  Secretariat at New Delhi, consisting of about 300 officials, in a hierarchical  set up.</p>
              <p align="justify"> Two or three Deputy Election  Commissioners and Director Generals who are the senior most officers in the Secretariat assist the  Commission. They are generally appointed from the national civil service of the  country and are selected and appointed by the Commission with tenure.  Directors, Principal Secretaries, and Secretaries, Under Secretaries and Deputy  Directors support the Deputy Election Commissioners and Director Generals in turn. There is functional  and territorial distribution of work in the Commission. The work is organised  in Divisions, Branches and sections; each of the last mentioned units is in  charge of a Section Officer. The main functional divisions are Planning,  Judicial, Administration, Systematic Votersâ€™  Education and Electoral Participation, SVEEP, Information Systems, Media and Secretariat Co-ordination. The territorial work  is distributed among separate units responsible for different Zones into which  the 35 constituent States and Union Territories of the country are grouped for  convenience of management.</p>
              <p align="justify"> At the state level, the  election work is supervised, subject to overall superintendence, direction and  control of the Commission, by the Chief Electoral Officer of the State, who is  appointed by the Commission from amongst senior civil servants proposed by the  concerned state government. He is, in most of the States, a full time officer  and has a small team of supporting staff.</p>
              <p align="justify"> At the district and  constituency levels, the District Election Officers, Electoral Registration  Officers and Returning Officers, who are assisted by a large number of junior  functionaries, perform election work. They all perform their functions relating  to elections in addition to their other responsibilities. During election time,  however, they are available to the Commission, more or less, on a full time  basis.</p>
              <p align="justify">The gigantic task force for conducting a countrywide general election  consists of nearly five million polling personnel and civil police forces. This  huge election machinery is deemed to be on deputation to the Election  Commission and is subject to its control, superintendence and discipline during  the election period, extending over a period of one and half to two months.</p>
              <p align="justify">
              </p><div id="Div3" align="right"><a href="#"><img src="./image/top.jpg" width="40" height="32" border="0"></a></div>
              <h3><a name="budget" id="budget"></a>Budget &amp; Expenditure</h3>
              <p align="justify">The Secretariat of the Commission has an independent budget, which is finalised directly in consultation between the Commission
                and the Finance Ministry of the Union Government. The latter generally accepts the recommendations of the Commission for its budgets.
                The major expenditure on actual conduct of elections is, however, reflected in the budgets of the concerned constituent units of the
                Union - States and Union Territories. If elections are being held only for the Parliament, the expenditure is borne entirely by the
                Union Government while for the elections being held only for the State Legislature, the expenditure is borne entirely by the concerned
                State. In case of simultaneous elections to the Parliament and State Legislature, the expenditure is shared equally between the Union
                and the State Governments. For Capital equipment, expenditure related to preparation for electoral rolls and the scheme for Electors'
                Identity Cards too, the expenditure is shared equally.&nbsp;</p>
              <div id="Div4" align="right"><a href="#"><img src="./image/top.jpg" width="40" height="32" border="0"></a></div>
              <h3><a name="executive" id="executive"></a>Executive Interference Barred</h3>
              <p align="justify">In the performance of its functions, Election Commission is insulated from executive interference. It is the Commission which
                decides the election schedules for the conduct of elections, whether general elections or bye-elections. Again, it is the Commission
                which decides on the location polling stations, assignment of voters to the polling stations, location of counting centres, arrangements
                to be made in and around polling stations and counting centres and all allied matters.</p>
              <h3><a name="politicalparties" id="politicalparties"></a>Political Parties &amp; the Commission</h3>
              <p align="justify">Political parties are registered with the Election Commission under the law. The Commission ensures inner party democracy in their
                functioning by insisting upon them to hold their organizational elections at periodic intervals. Political Parties so registered with
                it are granted recognition at the State and National levels by the Election Commission on the basis of their poll performance at general
                elections according to criteria prescribed by it. The Commission, as a part of its quasi-judicial jurisdiction, also settles disputes
                between the splinter groups of such recognised parties. </p>
              <p align="justify"> Election Commission ensures a level playing field for the political parties in election fray, through strict observance by them
                of a Model Code of Conduct evolved with the consensus of political parties.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="justify"> The Commission holds periodical consultations with the political parties on matters connected with the conduct of elections;
                compliance of Model Code of Conduct and new measures proposed to be introduced by the Commission on election related matters.&nbsp; </p>
              <div id="Div5" align="right"><a href="#"><img src="./image/top.jpg" width="40" height="32" border="0"></a></div>
              <h3><a name="advisory" id="advisory"></a>Advisory Jurisdiction &amp; Quasi-Judicial Functions </h3>
              <p align="justify">Under the Constitution, the Commission also has advisory jurisdiction in the matter of post election disqualification of sitting
                members of Parliament and State Legislatures. Further, the cases of persons found guilty of corrupt practices at elections which come
                before the Supreme Court and High Courts are also referred to the Commission for its opinion on the question as to whether such
                person shall be disqualified and, if so, for what period. The opinion of the Commission in all such matters is binding on the
                President or, as the case may be, the Governor to whom such opinion is tendered.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="justify"> The Commission has the power to disqualify a candidate who has failed to lodge an account of his election expenses within the
                time and in the manner prescribed by law. The Commission has also the power for removing or reducing the period of such disqualification
                as also other disqualification under the law. </p>
              <div id="Div6" align="right"><a href="#"><img src="./image/top.jpg" width="40" height="32" border="0"></a></div>
              <h3><a name="judicial" id="judicial"></a>Judicial Review</h3>
              <p align="justify"></p>
              The decisions of the Commission can be challenged in the High Court and the Supreme Court of the India by appropriate petitions.
              By long standing convention and several judicial pronouncements, once the actual process of elections has started, the judiciary
              does not intervene in the actual conduct of the polls. Once the polls are completed and result declared, the Commission cannot
              review any result on its own. This can only be reviewed through the process of an election petition, which can be filed before the
              High Court, in respect of elections to the Parliament and State Legislatures. In respect of elections for the offices of the President
              and Vice President, such petitions can only be filed before the Supreme Court.
              <div id="Div7" align="right"><a href="#"><img src="./image/top.jpg" width="40" height="32" border="0"></a></div>
              <h3><a name="media" id="media"></a>Media Policy</h3>
              <p align="justify">The Commission has a comprehensive policy for the media. It holds regular briefings for the mass media-print and electronic,
                on a regular basis, at close intervals during the election period and on specific occasions as necessary on other occasions.
                The representatives of the media are also provided facilities to report on actual conduct of poll and counting. They are allowed
                entry into polling stations and counting centres on the basis of authority letters issued by the Commission. They include members
                of both international and national media. The Commission also publishes statistical reports and other documents which are available
                in the public domain. The library of the Commission is available for research and study to members of the academic fraternity;
                media representatives and anybody else interested. </p>
              <p align="justify">The Commission has, in co-operation with the state owned media - Doordarshan and All India Radio, taken up a major campaign for
                awareness of voters. The Prasar Bharti Corporation which manages the national Radio and Television networks, has brought out
                several innovative and effective short clips for this purpose. </p>
              <div id="Div8" align="right"><a href="#"><img src="./image/top.jpg" width="40" height="32" border="0"></a></div>
              
              
              
              
 <h3><a name="voter" id="voter"></a>Voter Education</h3>
             <p align="justify"> Votersâ€™ Participation in the democratic  and electoral processes is integral to the successful running of any democracy  and the very basis of wholesome democratic elections. Recognising this,  Election Commission of India, in 2009, formally adopted Voter Education and Electoral participation as an integral part  of its election management.</p>

                recent past, the Commission has expanded international contacts by way of sharing of experience and expertise in the areas of
                Electoral Management and Administration, Electoral Laws and Reforms. Election Officials from the national electoral bodies and
                other delegates from the several countries - Russia, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Indonesia, South Africa, Bangladesh, Thailand, Nigeria,
                Namibia, Bhutan, Australia, the United States and Afghanistan etc. have visited the Commission for a better understanding of the
